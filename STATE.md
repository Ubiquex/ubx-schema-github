## In flight

Nothing in flight as of 2026-08-27.

## Blocked

Nothing blocked. Zero open PRs.

## Current release

Latest published: `v1.0.0` (verify directly — `gh api
repos/Ubiquex/ubx-schema-github/releases/tags/v1.0.0`). 2 members (`github`
resource, `github_ds` data-source). Does NOT carry a real
`min_binary_version` yet — predates that field (UBI-194). A pinned
`[providers.github]` resolution falls back to `ubiquex`'s own bootstrap table
(`schema_format 3 -> ubx-provider-dynamic 1.0.0`), confirmed working
correctly and logging visibly. Deliberately not forced to regenerate —
recommendation on record (UBI-194) is to let this happen naturally on this
repo's own weekly `hash-watch.yml` cron whenever GitHub's real API next
moves, rather than a metadata-only republish now.

## Before touching anything

- Never self-merge here. See `CLAUDE.md`.
- `hash-watch.yml` now builds against a real, tagged `ubx-provider-dynamic`
  release (fixed UBI-194) — a regeneration today would carry a real
  `min_binary_version` if it runs.
